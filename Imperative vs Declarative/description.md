##  Imperative
Imperative code uses statements and declarative code uses expressions. Expressions evaluate to a value while statements tell the computer to do something. In imperative programming, your code is based on statements that change the program state by telling the computer how to do things




## Declarative

Declarative programming can be achieved using inbuilt JavaScript methods. Declarative programming allows us to write code that is more readable and therefore, easier to understand. For instance, with declarative programming, we do not need to use a for loop to iterate over an array.
